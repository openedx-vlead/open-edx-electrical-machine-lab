<h1 style="color: #990000;">Objective</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">This test is performed to determine no-load current I0, no-load power factor cos &Oslash;0, windage and friction losses, no-load core loss, no-load input, and no-load resistance R0 and reactance X0. This test is performed with different values of applied voltage below and above rated voltage while the motor is running light (without load).</p>
<h1 style="color: #990000;">Overview</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">At no-load the machine runs at very small slip sufficient to provide power for windage and friction loss, core loss and also a certain amount of stator copper loss, which has to be, accounted for because of the large no load current.With low slip, the following approximation will hold good.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 10%;">R2&rsquo;(1/s-1) is very high</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 10%;">R2&rsquo;/s&gt;&gt;X2&rsquo;</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">With these approximations the necessary formulae for finding out Xm will be given while conducting the no-load test.</p>
