<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenz&rsquo;s law is normally associated with determining the direction of an electric current that has been induced by electromagnetic induction. It is a law which is seen to be closely connected with the law of conservation of energy, even though it relates to scenarios that involve non-conservative forces. These non-conservative forces will always encounter an inertial resistance which has to be overcomed. In overcoming this inertial resistance, energy is always used up in equal amount to the new energy that has been created. Lenz&rsquo;s law is therefore not restricted to electromagnetic induction. It applies equally to linear polarization, capacitor circuits, and to matters relating to changes in linear momentum. Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion are a mechanical manifestation of Lenz&rsquo;s law. The direction of current is defined by the right hand thumb rule.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To produce a rotating magnetic field more than one coil is required. Here a two coil system is used. We get rotating magnetic field at various angle positions of the two coils. For example, when the two coils are shifted 90 degree apart, we get a rotating magnetic field. The magnetic field generated due to AC current is illustrated here.The change in magnetic field pattern due to frequency change can also be studied.</p>
