<h1 style="color: #990000;">Overview</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The DC resistance test is performed to measure the resistance of the stator by circulating a suitable direct current and then measuring the voltage drop between terminals. The test, if taken with the motor cold (at room temperature) provides a check for the calculated values, or a basis for the estimation of efficiency.</p>
