<h2><span style="color: #333399;">Overview</span></h2>
<p align="justify"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big>This is a starting method that reduces the starting current and starting torque. At starting the Induction motor is star connected after it reached the approximate operational speed it is switch to delta. The motor must be delta connected during a normal run, in order to be able to use this starting method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This starting method only works when the application is light loaded during the start. If the motor is too heavily loaded, there will not be enough torque to accelerate the motor up to speed before switching over to the delta position.</p>
