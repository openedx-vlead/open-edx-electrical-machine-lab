<h2>Two coils AC</h2>
<p style="color: #000000;">1. Connect one terminal of the red coil to phase A and one terminal of the blue coil to phase B. Connect the other two terminals of the two coils to the neutral.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">2. Connect the Hall Sensors to the channels of the oscilloscope. Then select the channels.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">3. Now check the connection. If it is correct, click OK.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">4. If it is wrong, see the error message displayed and correct the connections.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">5. Switch on the MCB.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">6. Now change frequencies and currents to see the mathematical representation , the graph in the oscilloscope, the formation of flux lines and the vector summation of the magnetic flux densities .</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">7. Change the coil positions and the phase shifts to see the difference in the mathematical representation , the graph in the oscilloscope, the formation of flux lines and the vector summation of the magnetic flux densities .</p>
