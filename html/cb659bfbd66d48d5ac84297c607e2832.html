<h2>Three coil AC</h2>
<p style="color: #000000;">1. Connect one terminal of the red coil to phase A, one terminal of the blue coil to phase B and , one terminal of the green coil to phase C. Connect the remaining terminals of the three coils to the neutral.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">2. Connect the Hall Sensors to the channels of the oscilloscope. Then select the channels.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">3. Now check the connection. If it is correct, click OK .</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">4. If it is wrong, see the error message displayed and correct the connections.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">5. Switch on the MCB.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">6. Now change frequencies and currents to see the mathematical representation , the graph in the oscilloscope, the formation of flux lines and the vector summation of the magnetic flux densities .</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">7. Change the coil position and the phase shift to see the difference in the mathematical representation, the graph in the oscilloscope, the formation of flux lines and the vector summation of the magnetic flux densities .</p>
